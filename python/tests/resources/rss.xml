                    <description>Fox Nation&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Showdown at the Panama Canal&amp;quot; explores the history of the vital strategic waterway and the current high-stakes battle to reclaim control.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/taking-back-internal-house-gop-memo-outlines-case-trump-buy-panama-canal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;The Panama Canal&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most strategically vital waterways in the world. An engineering marvel that transformed global commerce, this maritime shortcut solidified the U.S.&apos; geopolitical power and drastically reduced the time needed to cross between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; claims the crucial pathway is in Chinese hands, and his threat to &quot;take it back&quot; has left it at the crux of a high-stakes international standoff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But does China really control a structure once built by the U.S. itself? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins headed south to find out in the latest Fox Nation special, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Showdown at the Panama Canal.&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/panama-pledges-end-key-canal-deal-china-work-us-after-rubio-visit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;PANAMA PLEDGES TO END KEY CANAL DEAL WITH CHINA, WORK WITH US AFTER RUBIO VISIT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing in front of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/trade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;massive cargo ship&lt;/a&gt; and blue waters at his back, Jenkins ventured into the history and geopolitical importance of the canal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This ship was in the Atlantic this morning, transiting to the Pacific. It will take them about eight hours,&quot; he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;As explored in the special&lt;/a&gt;, without the canal, the trip would take weeks — upwards of 25 to 26 days — and would require a trip around South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Panama Canal lets them cut through Central America, knocking between 8,000 and 10,000 miles off the trip and saving millions of dollars in fuel and other costs,&quot; Jenkins added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-carter-very-fine-person-panama-canal-moves-were-a-big-mistake&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP: CARTER WAS A ‘VERY FINE’ PERSON BUT PANAMA CANAL MOVES WERE ‘A BIG MISTAKE’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the strategic resource goes beyond sending containers and products globally. It&apos;s also a crucial military asset, enabling warships to quickly pass through in times of crisis, when they can&apos;t afford extra weeks of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dream conjured up by&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;President Teddy Roosevelt was ultimately achieved through a treaty signed between the U.S. and freshly-independent Panama in 1903. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The canal remained under U.S. control until 1999, when control was ceded to Panama as a byproduct of treaties signed under President Jimmy Carter&apos;s tenure two decades prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/taking-back-internal-house-gop-memo-outlines-case-trump-buy-panama-canal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘TAKING IT BACK:’ INTERNAL HOUSE GOP MEMO OUTLINES CASE FOR TRUMP TO BUY PANAMA CANAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though now a symbol of Panamanian pride, President Trump has his sights set on the canal, warning of national security threats posed by alleged Chinese control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panama&apos;s president vowed earlier this month to end a key &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;development deal with China&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and amid Trump&apos;s complaints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To discover more about the high-stakes battle over the Panama Canal and the history of the vital waterway, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;sign up for Fox Nation&lt;/a&gt; and begin streaming today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nation.foxnews.com/featured/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=Boiler::add=DigitalBoilerUnit_&amp;amp;utm_source=referral&amp;amp;utm_medium=FNC_web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Boiler&amp;amp;utm_content=DigitalBoilerUnit_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO JOIN FOX NATION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The film, which has been lauded as the modern &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; follows Anora, a young woman from Brooklyn, who gets her chance at a Cinderella story when she meets and marries the son of an oligarch.

It is about a family that endured a military dictatorship in the 1970s. The film is based on the memoir of Marcelo Rubens Paiva and tells the true story of Eunice Paiva, a wife and mother who begins a lonely battle to learn the truth behind her husband&apos;s disappearance, former Brazilian Labor Party deputy Rubens Paiva while trying to keep her family together. The movie stars Fernanda Torres as Eunice Paiva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m Still Here&quot; has received several awards, including a Golden Globe for Torres, and three nominations at the Academy Awards, including Best Picture, becoming the first time a Brazilian film has been nominated in the category. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/im-still-here/umc.cmc.4yxcgs8ksgoik23teosvfdozy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored noopener&quot;&gt;stream the movie on Apple TV with a subscription&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nickel Boys&quot; is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Colson Whitehead that tells the story of a strong friendship between two Black teenagers who meet when they are sent to an abusive reform school in the 1960s Florida, inspired by the Dozier School for Boys, a now-closed reform school in Florida known for its mistreatment of students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the teens, Elwood Curtis, sees his dreams of attending college shattered when he is sentenced to Nickel Academy, a brutal reformatory in the Jim Crow South. Despite his harsh realities, Elwood remains optimistic and forms a friendship with Turner, another Black teenager who shares crucial survival tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film explores the Civil Rights Movement through the experiences of Elwood and Turner. Telling their story from their perspectives creates an intimate and emotionally impactful experience for the audience. The film has been nominated for two Oscars, including Best Picture. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/nickel-boys/umc.cmc.6d0x8osffe4fry5sr8w1ez8q4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored noopener&quot;&gt;stream &quot;Nickel Boys&quot; on Apple TV&lt;/a&gt; with a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Substance&quot; tells the story of what lengths a woman will go to preserve her youth. This modern horror film stars Demi Moore as Elizabeth Sparkle, an aging celebrity who takes a black-market drug that temporarily creates a younger, better version of herself but has some nasty side effects.  The injectable drug allows a fading star to swap bodies with a younger, more beautiful woman, but the two bodies must switch consciousness every seven days without exception. Not following the prescription leads to some very grotesque consequences and drives the older Elizabeth to horrific measures that make for a very macabre look at the societal pressures women face with aging in the beauty industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore has already won a Golden Globe for Best Actress and has been nominated for the category by the Academy Award. The film is also up for another four nominations, including Best Picture. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3CSlV8S&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;sponsored noopener&quot;&gt;rent &quot;The Substance&quot; for $5.99 or buy it for $19.99 on Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;.

The musical is told from the perspective of two witches, Elphaba, played by Cynthia Erivo, and Glinda, played by Ariana Grande, before Dorothy&apos;s arrival in Oz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story explores the complex friendship between Elphaba, who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West, and Galinda, who becomes Glinda the Good. You get the whole backstory of why things exist the way they do in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot; There are some spectacular musical numbers that even viewers not familiar with the Broadway show will love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film has been nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress.

                    <description>Bill Demory, a former quarterback for the New York Jets and Arizona in college, has died at the age of 74, according to an online obituary.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bill Demory, a former quarterback for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-jets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York Jets&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s, died earlier this month, according to an obituary posted online. He was 74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demory battled prostate cancer and Parkinson’s disease, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.azcentral.com/obituaries/pazs1097842&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;AZ Central&lt;/a&gt;. The obituary said he died &quot;peacefully&quot; on Feb. 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born in Iowa but moved to Arizona with his family when he was young and attended high school in Phoenix. He attended the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/arizona-wildcats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;University of Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and was a quarterback for the Wildcats for three seasons before he turned pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 27 collegiate games, Demory had 3,268 passing yards and 28 touchdown passes. Arizona did not have a winning record when he was there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/keanu-neal-one-time-pro-bowler-announces-retirement-after-8-nfl-seasons&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KEANU NEAL, ONE-TIME PRO BOWLER, ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT AFTER 8 NFL SEASONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He joined the Jets in 1973 and started in three of the six games he played in. He had 159 passing yards, two touchdown passes and eight interceptions that season. He was in a quarterback room that included Al Woodall and Joe Namath. New York finished 4-10 that season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1974, the Jets were 7-7 with Namath leading the charge. Demory never saw the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Central noted that before Nick Foles started a game in the NFL, Demory was one of three quarterbacks who played at Arizona and started an NFL game. Eddie Wilson and Fred Enke were the other two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demory was later an economics professor at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/education&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Arizona Western&lt;/a&gt; and Central Arizona College from 1999 to 2016 and an adjunct teacher at Mesa Community College from 1998 to 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is survived by his wife, two sons, two daughters, 14 grandchildren, two step-children and his brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Democrat Rep Ritchie Torres endorses Cuomo for New York City mayor over Eric Adams: report</title>
                    
                    <description>Democrat Rep. Ritchie Torres said he is backing Andrew Cuomo for New York City mayor, parting with incumbent Eric Adams before June&amp;apos;s primary.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., has endorsed Andrew Cuomo to run for mayor of New York City in the latest blow to incumbent Democrat first-termer, Mayor &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ericadams&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Eric Adams. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The two most important things we need are competence and courage,&quot; Torres, who represents the Bronx, told the New York Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/andrew-cuomo&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;Andrew Cuomo&lt;/a&gt; has the competence to govern the city. He has the courage to stand up to extremist politics – both from the far left and far right,&quot; Torres said, adding: &quot;We don’t need a Mr. Nice Guy. We need a Mr. Tough Guy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuomo has not formally declared his candidacy for mayor but is rumored to announce soon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He has my endorsement as soon as he enters the race,&quot; Torres told the Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cuomo-responds-ex-new-york-officials-calls-him-nyc-mayor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CUOMO RESPONDS AFTER EX-NEW YORK OFFICIAL CALLS FOR HIM TO BE NYC MAYOR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former governor resigned in 2021 amid scandals connected to COVID-19 nursing home deaths and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/former-new-york-state-governor-andrew-cuomos-sexual-harassment-accuser-drops-federal-lawsuit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;sexual harassment claims.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cuomo has always denied the allegations against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I predict the comeback story of the 2025 election will be the resurrection of Andrew Cuomo,&quot; Torres told the Post. &quot;America loves a comeback, New York loves a comeback.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to Torres&apos; office for comment Monday and was referred to the congressman&apos;s appearance on CNBC. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Andrew Cuomo is a common sense Democrat,&quot; Torres told CNBC Monday. &quot;For me the two most important virtues in politics are competence and courage. And Andrew Cuomo has the competence to run New York City in a moment of crisis, and he has the courage to stand up to the extremes of American politics whether it&apos;s the far right or the far left. There&apos;s a mayoral candidate who openly identifies with the Democratic Socialists of America, which celebrated the mass murder of Jews on Oct. 7, and so when it comes to confronting political extremism in New York, when it comes to confronting the crisis of crime, we need not a nice guy, but a tough guy like Andrew Cuomo.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asked whether it was an endorsement of Cuomo or an indictment of Adams, Torres said it was both, arguing that New York City is &quot;in crisis&quot; after four deputy mayors resigned and &quot;the city is less safe than it should be.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;What we now need more than ever is the kind of stable and strong and steady leadership that Governor Cuomo can provide, and the effectiveness of Andrew Cuomo as an executive need not be taken on faith. It is a fact,&quot; Torres said. &quot;We as New Yorkers every day live and feel the legacy of Andrew Cuomo as a great builder of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Cuomo disseminated a letter from former state comptroller Carl McCall, a prominent Democrat and Black elder statesman, backing him for mayor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCall endorsed Adams, who is New York City’s second Black mayor, in his 2021 campaign for the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/mayor-eric-adams-says-nycs-roosevelt-hotel-migrant-shelter-soon-close&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SAYS NYC&apos;S ROOSEVELT HOTEL MIGRANT SHELTER WILL SOON CLOSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams already faces multiple challengers in June&apos;s Democratic primary, but Cuomo is polling as the front-runner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal judge on Friday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-adjourns-case-against-new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams-stops-short-dismissing-charges&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;canceled a corruption trial&lt;/a&gt; for Adams and appointed counsel to advise the court about President Donald Trump&apos;s Justice Department’s controversial request to drop charges against the mayor filed under the Biden administration. Adams has denied allegations of a quid pro quo agreement with the Trump administration, as the Democratic mayor cooperates with federal law enforcement on the president&apos;s criminal illegal immigration crackdown. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I want a mayor who can governor independently of the far right and Donald Trump represents the far right,&quot; Torres told CNBC. &quot;What I found striking is Donald Trump made the decision not to pardon Eric Adams or to permanently drop the charges, but only to do so temporarily, and so the fear of a reindictment keeps Mayor Adams permanently under the thumb of Donald Trump.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Dale E. Ho&apos;s written order Friday means he will not decide before mid-March whether to grant the dismissal of the case against the embattled mayor of the nation’s largest city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ho said he appointed Paul Clement, a former U.S. solicitor general under former President George W. Bush, to present arguments on the government’s request to drop the case.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>Elon Musk and President Donald Trump shared a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed meme after Musk announced government workers would receive an email seeking information about what they accomplished last week</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; shared a SpongeBob SquarePants-themed meme after Elon Musk announced that federal workers would receive an email seeking information about what they accomplished last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meme features a list titled, &quot;Got Done Last Week.&quot; The five items on the list include, &quot;Cried about Trump,&quot; &quot;Cried about Elon,&quot; &quot;Made it into the office for once,&quot; &quot;Read some emails,&quot; and &quot;Cried about Trump and Elon some more.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump shared the meme on Truth Social shortly after Musk shared it on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bureaucracies-cannibalizing-our-nation-lawmaker-says-expressing-empathy-federal-workers-facing-job-cuts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUREAUCRACIES ‘CANNIBALIZING OUR NATION’ LAWMAKER SAYS, EXPRESSING EMPATHY FOR FEDERAL WORKERS FACING JOB CUTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musk had previously declared in a tweet, &quot;Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement came as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elon-musk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Musk seeks to &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elon-musk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;uncover &lt;/a&gt;government waste, fraud, and abuse as the Trump administration seeks to shrink the massive federal bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A large number of good responses have been received already. These are the people who should be considered for promotion,&quot; Musk noted in another tweet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/elon-musk-federal-employees-fill-out-productivity-reports-resign&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ELON MUSK SAYS FEDERAL EMPLOYEES MUST FILL OUT PRODUCTIVITY REPORTS OR RESIGN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some have raised objections to the email sent to government workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska referred to it as &quot;absurd.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our public workforce deserves to be treated with dignity and respect for the unheralded jobs they perform.

Congratulations Dan!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Another aspect of the life of Dan Bongino that I think is very important.

                    <title>Logan Paul &apos;never doing&apos; at least 1 high-risk move in WWE again</title>
                    
                    <description>Logan Paul has become one of the top heels in WWE since he made his first appearance in 2021. His wrestling moves landed him credibility with the audience.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Logan Paul has left an indelible impression on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/wwe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;WWE fans&lt;/a&gt; with his wrestling prowess since he entered the squared circle for the company in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Maverick&quot; has been seen in multiple premium live events, went viral for his wild moves off the ropes and was even the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wrestlemania-40-logan-paul-fends-off-kevin-owens-randy-orton-to-retain-us-championship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;United States champion&lt;/a&gt; for a time last year. Even with someone who has had as much success as the podcaster and social media star, he made clear there was one move he never wanted to perform again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul posted a video of himself performing the moonsault and battery on Rey Mysterio during a recent match on &quot;Monday Night Raw.&quot; The maneuver involved Paul picking up Mysterio from the middle turnbuckle and flipping backward with him in his arms. Only a handful of pro wrestlers across the industry perform the move as it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, for Paul, his days doing that seemed to be over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Never doing that again,&quot; he wrote on Instagram, tagging WWE in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wwe-nxt-star-roxanne-perez-dishes-cm-punks-mentorship-since-his-return&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WWE NXT STAR ROXANNE PEREZ DISHES ON CM PUNK&apos;S MENTORSHIP SINCE HIS RETURN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul used the move to help beat Mysterio in a qualifying match for the Elimination Chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men’s Elimination Chamber match is on Saturday. The event will see Paul, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/john-cenas-farewell-tour-begins-major-announcement-raws-netflix-premiere&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;John Cena&lt;/a&gt;, Seth Rollins, CM Punk, Damian Priest and Drew McIntyre vie for an opportunity to go to WrestleMania 41 and compete for the Undisputed WWE Championship, which is held by Cody Rhodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jey Uso won the Royal Rumble and will take on Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship at Wrestlemania 41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul competed in the Elimination Chamber match last year, but it was McIntyre who was victorious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Trump&apos;s new SBA chief unleashes &apos;Day One&apos; priorities to transform agency into &apos;golden era of prosperity&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>New Small Business Administration chief Kelly Loeffler has issued a memo outlining the agency&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Day One&amp;quot; priorities aimed at &amp;quot;empowering small businesses and fueling economic growth.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX: &lt;/strong&gt;Newly-confirmed Small Business Administration (SBA) administrator Kelly Loeffler is unveiling the agency&apos;s top priorities over the next four years as she aims to work with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;President Trump&lt;/a&gt; to create a &quot;golden era of prosperity and growth.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loeffler, confirmed in the Senate by a 52–46 margin last week, issued a &quot;Day One&quot; memo on Monday outlining the top priorities for the agency that will be tasked with the directive to &quot;carry out President Trump’s America First agenda and empower small businesses to thrive&quot; and to become an &quot;America First engine for free enterprise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first priority on the list is promoting a &quot;Made in America&quot; agenda to boost U.S. manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The vast majority of America’s manufacturers are small businesses, and SBA programs have powered tens of thousands of them,&quot; the memo states. &quot;This agency is committed to supporting the America First agenda by rebuilding American supply chains and investing in manufacturing to strengthen our economy and national security.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/president-trump-looks-bring-manufacturing-back-us-tariffs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRESIDENT TRUMP LOOKS TO BRING MANUFACTURING BACK TO US WITH TARIFFS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The agency will transform its Office of International Trade into the ‘Office of Manufacturing and Trade’ – which will focus on promoting economic independence, job creation, and fair trade practices to power the next blue-collar boom. SBA will also partner across agencies to scale innovative manufacturing and technology startups that will help our nation return to ‘Made in America.’&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since being sworn in as president for the second time, Trump has been vocal about eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) from the federal government while also tasking Tesla CEO Elon Musk with leading the effort to cut wasteful spending with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elon-musk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loeffler&apos;s memo states that the SBA intends to be an ally in both of those efforts and says it will enforce Trump&apos;s executive orders, including &quot;Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,&quot; &quot;Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,&quot; and &quot;Unleashing American Energy.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-gave-americans-business-trump-giving-businessmen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIDEN GAVE AMERICANS THE BUSINESS. TRUMP IS GIVING US BUSINESSMEN &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo says that the SBA will &quot;continue working closely&quot; with DOGE and &quot;prioritize eliminating fraud and waste within the agency, to ensure American taxpayer dollars are utilized in the most productive way possible to benefit small businesses and economic growth and resilience.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency will work to eliminate wasteful spending and fraud with a &quot;zero-tolerance policy&quot; that will involve fraud investigations across all programs and appointing a &quot;Fraud Czar&quot; to &quot;identify, stop, and claw back criminally obtained funds on behalf of American taxpayers – working across agencies to prevent fraud.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SBA will also conduct an agency-wide financial audit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As fraud has risen, so too have delinquencies, defaults, and charge-offs on loan programs, exacerbated by the previous Administration’s lax loan underwriting, servicing, and collection efforts,&quot; the memo states. &quot;As a result, SBA has been unable to satisfactorily complete a financial audit for several consecutive years.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Therefore, the agency will request an independent audit of its financials to address mismanagement, restore the credibility of financial statements, and preserve the solvency of public-private programs like the 7(a) lending program and the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, which are designed to drive economic growth without taxpayer subsidy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-ultimatum-federal-workers-return-office-or-terminated&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;told federal employees&lt;/a&gt; working from home that they would need to return to the office or face termination, which is a sentiment echoed by Loeffler, who said in her memo that all non-exempt employees will report to work in person on Monday for five days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s immigration agenda will also be furthered by the SBA, according to the memo, which will ban illegal immigrants from receiving SBA assistance while also &quot;restricting hostile foreign nationals from accessing SBA assistance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo outlines a variety of ways that the agency will work on &quot;empowering small businesses,&quot; including a strike force to cut regulations, improving customer service and cybersecurity, promoting fair competition, and relocating offices outside of sanctuary cities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/key-biden-agency-slapped-with-another-subpoena-voter-registration-push-crucial-swing-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the SBA has faced criticism in recent years during the Biden administration from the Republican-led Small Business Committee, which issued a subpoena and alleged that the agency failed to turn over information related to efforts to funnel resources to help register swing state voters. Republicans argued those efforts were unconstitutional, and Loeffler&apos;s memo pledges that the registration efforts in question will be ended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The SBA will end all taxpayer-funded voter registration activities – starting by rescinding the agency’s 2024 MOU with the Michigan Secretary of State’s office, which forced SBA district offices to conduct partisan voter registration on behalf of the previous Administration,&quot; the memo states. &quot;Instead, the agency will return its focus to its founding mission of empowering job creators, delivering disaster relief, and driving economic growth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loeffler, who served as a senator in Georgia from 2020-2021, appeared before the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee on Jan. 28 to outline her vision and promised that Trump’s policies would &quot;restore the small business economy&quot; and would lead to a &quot;golden era of prosperity and growth.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Small businesses are the backbone of our nation, driving innovation, job creation, and prosperity – and there’s no stronger advocate for small business than President Trump or myself. But over the last four years, the SBA has burdened entrepreneurs with bureaucracy – with its programs becoming mired in fraud, waste, and abuse,&quot; Loeffler told Fox News Digital in a statement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That changes today. My first priority is rebuilding the SBA into an America First engine for free enterprise – by empowering small businesses and fueling economic growth.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A former French surgeon accused of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;raping or sexually abusing&lt;/a&gt; 299 victims, mostly children under his care, over the course of nearly three decades is set to stand trial in France on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joël Le Scouarnec, now 74, is set to stand trial over four months in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/france&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Vannes, Brittany&lt;/a&gt;. The trial will examine alleged rapes and other abuses committed between 1989 and 2014 against 158 men and 141 women. The alleged victims’ average age was 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le Scouarnec, who will face hundreds of alleged victims during the trial, does not deny the allegations, though he says he doesn&apos;t remember everything. Many alleged victims say they have no memory of the assaults, having been unconscious at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was brought into the spotlight in 2017 when a 6-year-old neighbor accused Le Scouarnec of touching her over the fence that separated their properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/frenchman-found-guilty-horrific-rape-trial-shocked-world&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRENCHMAN FOUND GUILTY IN HORRIFIC RAPE TRIAL THAT SHOCKED THE WORLD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators searched his home and uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, according to investigation documents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation further found that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;surgeon described himself&lt;/a&gt; in his notebooks as a pedophile and revealed details of his actions. Investigators tracked down alleged victims whose names were found written in the notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le Scouarnec was convicted in that case in 2020, along with the rape and sexual assault of his two nieces when they were children in the 1980s and 90s, and a 4-year-old patient. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amélie Lévêque, one of the alleged victims named in the notebooks, was 9 years old at the time of her surgery in 1991. When speaking about the revelations recently, she said she recalled little about the operation, although she remembered &quot;a surgeon who was quite mean&quot; following the procedure, noting that she &quot;cried a lot.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described being contacted over the discovery of her name in the notebooks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/french-girl-11-found-dead-near-school-murder-investigation-underway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FRENCH GIRL, 11, FOUND DEAD NEAR SCHOOL, MURDER INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was the beginning of the answers to a lifetime of questions, and then it was the beginning of the descent into hell,&quot; Lévêque told public broadcaster France 3. &quot;I felt like I had lost control of everything. I wasn’t crazy, but now I had to face the truth of what had happened.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I fell into a deep depression. ... My family tried to help, but I felt completely alone,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le Scouarnec was previously convicted in 2005 of possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le Scouarnec faces up to 20 years in prison &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/trials&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;if convicted in this trial,&lt;/a&gt; on top of 15 years he has been serving after being found guilty in 2020 of rape and sexual assault of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <description>European leaders voiced support for Ukraine on the third anniversary of the Russia invasion while demanding a say in any US-Russia peace arrangement.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On the third anniversary of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Russian invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Ukraine, European leaders are showing support for Kyiv, while also expressing unease about the current state of the conflict with President Donald Trump&apos;s administration at the negotiating table. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winner of Germany’s election on Sunday – conservative leader Friedrich Merz – has been a staunch backer of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;More than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength,&quot; Merz, whose victory&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-celebrates-conservative-party-win-germany&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt; was celebrated by Trump,&lt;/a&gt; posted to X on Monday. &quot;For a fair peace, the country that is under attack must be part of peace negotiations.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and some European leaders took issue with Kyiv being left out of talks between U.S. and Russian diplomats in Saudi Arabia last week geared toward ending the war. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/ukraine-enters-fourth-year-war-russia-closer-beginning-than-end&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UKRAINE ENTERS FOURTH YEAR OF WAR WITH RUSSIA: ‘CLOSER TO THE BEGINNING THAN WE ARE TO THE END’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dozen leaders from Europe and Canada were in Ukraine&apos;s capital on Monday to mark three years since Russian troops invaded on Feb. 24, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were among visitors scheduled to attend anniversary events and discuss supporting Ukraine with Zelenskyy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier – primarily the ceremonial head of state – said &quot;peace and freedom in Europe demand of us that we support Ukraine resolutely.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Germany stands &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;firmly beside Ukraine,&lt;/a&gt; with humanitarian aid, with protection for refugees, with military support,&quot; Steinmeier said in the video message, parts of which were aired on Ukrainian television. &quot;And we will not ease up as long as this illegal war lasts.&quot; Steinmeier reportedly planned to join a video summit Zelenskyy was holding Monday with leaders of supportive nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anniversary comes amid escalating public tensions between Trump and Zelenskyy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job,&quot; Trump said Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also dubbed the Ukrainian leader &quot;a dictator without elections,&quot; following Zelenskyy&apos;s accusation that Trump is living in a Russian-made &quot;disinformation space.&quot; In an interview with the Daily Mail, Vice President JD Vance warned that &quot;the idea &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/volodymyr-zelenskyy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;that Zelenskyy is going&lt;/a&gt; to change the president&apos;s mind by badmouthing him in public media, everyone who knows the President will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s former national security adviser John Bolton characterized Trump&apos;s remarks as &quot;shameful,&quot; while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pence-positions-himself-leading-republican-voice-willing-challenge-trump-its-not-personal&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;former Vice President Mike Pence&lt;/a&gt; condemned the president for suggesting that Ukraine was at fault in the war. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy mentioned speaking Sunday with Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump had a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and then Zelenskyy afterward, last week. Trump&apos;s Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg arrived in Kyiv last Wednesday to meet with Zelenskyy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union’s top diplomat insisted Monday that the U.S. cannot seal any peace deal to end the war with Putin without Ukraine or Europe being involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas also highlighted what she claimed were pro-Russian positions being taken up by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You can discuss whatever you want with Putin. But if it comes to Europe or Ukraine, then Ukraine and Europe also have to agree to this deal,&quot; Kallas told reporters in Brussels, where she is chairing a meeting of EU foreign ministers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kallas travels to Washington on Tuesday for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. In terms of the U.S. message, she said it was &quot;clear that the Russian narrative is there very strongly represented.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said Monday that the last few &quot;turbulent weeks&quot; surrounding the push to bring an end to the war had brought European nations &quot;face to face with history.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today marks the start of the fourth year of the terrible war. Let us hope that it also marks the beginning of the end,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-sounds-off-zelenskyys-insults-us-works-broker-ukraine-peace-deal-russia-ive-had-it&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;TRUMP SOUNDS OFF ON ZELENSKYY&apos;S INSULTS AS US WORKS TO BROKER UKRAINE PEACE DEAL WITH RUSSIA: &apos;I&apos;VE HAD IT&apos;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finnish President Alexander Stubb said Europe needs &quot;to make clear to the Russians and everyone else that there are a few things that are completely off the table in these negotiations.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One is EU membership. It is not Russia who decides on EU membership, it is the European Union who does that. Two is NATO. It is not Russia that decides on NATO membership. It is the alliance itself,&quot; he declared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will see a European Ukraine. We will see eventually Ukraine in NATO,&quot; Stubb said. &quot;We’ve seen a unified European Union and hopefully a stronger trans-Atlantic alliance in the long run. And on a day like this, I think it’s time to pave the way for a plan for Ukrainian victory.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump&apos;s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, notably suggested Sunday that Russia was &quot;provoked&quot; ahead of the Ukraine invasion by increasing talks of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/nato&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Kyiv joining NATO. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Czech President Petr Pavel said via remote link that he has &quot;no doubt that the ultimate goal of this aggression has always been to wipe Ukraine as we know it off the map.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yet the resilience of the Ukrainian people has proven to be unbreakable,&quot; Pavel told the gathering of European leaders in Kyiv. &quot;It deserves not only our admiration, but also our full respect. We all sincerely want peace in Ukraine and for its people, but not a peace at any cost.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/vladimir-putin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Putin’s spokesperson,&lt;/a&gt; Dmitry Peskov, said Russia does not see any way to resume &quot;dialogue with Europe&quot; after the European Union adopted its 16th round of sanctions against Russia on the third anniversary of the invasion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures include targeting Russia’s so-called &quot;shadow fleet&quot; of ships that it exploits to skirt restrictions on transporting oil and gas, or to carry stolen Ukrainian grain. The EU said 74 vessels were added to its list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the new sanctions also target &quot;those who support the operation of unsafe oil tankers, videogame controllers used to pilot drones, banks used to circumvent our sanctions, and propaganda outlets used to spout lies.&quot; Asset freezes and travel bans were imposed on 83 officials and entities. More than 2,300 officials and entities have been hit since the invasion began, Putin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adding new sanctions, European nations appear to be convinced that the war should continue, Peskov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stands in contrast with searching for ways to resolve &quot;the conflict around Ukraine which is what we are currently doing with the Americans,&quot; Peskov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking about Russia’s changing relationship with the U.S., Peskov welcomed &quot;attempts by Washington to really understand what was the root cause of this conflict.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N. General Assembly, meanwhile, is expected to vote Monday on dueling resolutions: Ukraine’s European-backed proposal demanding an immediate withdrawal of Russian forces from the country and a U.S. call for a swift end to the war that never mentions Moscow’s aggression, the Associated Press reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The massive Roosevelt Hotel migrant shelter in Manhattan will shut down in the next few months, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ericadams&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York City Mayor Eric Adams&lt;/a&gt; announced Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The converted facility, which has around 1,000 rooms, has processed more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;173,000 migrants&lt;/a&gt; since its opening in May 2023, according to the New York Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;While we’re not done caring for those that came into our care, today marks another milestone in demonstrating the immense progress we have achieved in turning the corner on the unprecedented international humanitarian effort,&quot; Adams was quoted by the newspaper as saying in a video announcement Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He reportedly added that the closure – which a source told &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/02/24/us-news/nycs-notorious-roosevelt-hotel-shelter-will-be-migrant-free-in-coming-months-mayor-eric-adams-says/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;the Post&lt;/a&gt; is expected to happen by June – is because of &quot;the successful strategies we put in place here in New York City and because of policies we advocated for at the border.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nyc-sues-after-trump-admin-claws-back-80m-migrant-housing-grant&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NYC SUES AFTER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CLAWS BACK $80 MILLION MIGRANT HOUSING GRANT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City had around 69,000 migrants in its shelter system in January 2024, but that number has currently dropped to less than 45,000, city officials told the Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, there were 4,000 migrants showing up to the Big Apple every week, yet that number too has dropped to an average of 350, the newspaper added, citing Adams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the final few weeks of Joe Biden’s presidency, around 400-500 new migrants were requesting city help every week, the Post also reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/turned-corner-blue-city-announces-shuttering-migrant-shelters-numbers-drop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK CITY ANNOUNCES CLOSING OF MIGRANT SHELTERS AS NUMBERS DROP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams’ office did not immediately respond Monday morning to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anticipated closure of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/reputed-migrant-gang-members-busted-nyc-drug-gun-raid-likely-avoid-prosecution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Roosevelt Hotel shelter&lt;/a&gt; – which reportedly has been linked to gang activity as well – comes as New York City has been shuttering other migrant care sites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re going to continue looking for more sites to consolidate and close, and more opportunities to save taxpayer money, as we continue to successfully manage this response,&quot; Adams said in December when he announced that 25 shelters are closing in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Migrants who arrive after the Roosevelt Hotel shelter closure will have other locations in New York City to register, city officials told the Post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News’ Michael Dorgan contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NASCAR driver Carson Hocevar draws ire from fellow racers amid 2nd-place finish at Atlanta</title>
                    
                    <description>NASCAR driver Carson Hocevar drew backlash from his fellow racers on Sunday because of his over-aggressive driving during the Ambetter Health 400.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Carson Hocevar drew the ire of multiple drivers on Sunday night during the Ambetter Health 400 at Atlanta Motor Speedway in the second race of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/nascar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NASCAR Cup Series&lt;/a&gt; 2025 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hocevar finished in second place as a caution flag came out in the middle of the final lap. It meant the driver who was in the lead at the time of the caution was declared the winner. This time, it was Christopher Bell who won the race, with Hocevar and Kyle Larson behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after the race, multiple drivers were seen speaking with Hocevar. The 22-year-old’s aggressive driving did not appear to go over well with some of his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We’re here to win races, not be a boy band and love each other and play on the playground together,&quot; Hocevar said, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2025/02/23/three-up-three-down-drivers-in-focus-leaving-atlanta/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;via NASCAR.com&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;So obviously, there’s learning lessons. You don’t want to p--- anybody off or frustrate anybody, and there’s things I would clean up for sure. But it’s just going to come with learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Again, I’m normally 40th, waiting for them to crash and hoping they crash, and I finish in the teens. So, to be up front and get stage points in both stages and have a shot to win is something to hold my (head) high. … And I’ve always said I’m a really bad superspeedway racer, so this at least gives me a little bit more confidence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/chase-briscoe-penalty-daytona-500&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHASE BRISCOE ISSUED HEFTY PENALTY FOR DAYTONA 500 SPOILER INFRACTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ross Chastain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/2025-nascar-odds-ambetter-health-400&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Ryan Blaney&lt;/a&gt; and Kyle Busch were among those who reacted to Hocevar’s racing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Blaney was driving for first place, he received a bump from Hocevar on Lap 234. Blaney was sent spinning, and a caution flag came out. Blaney was able to save his car and made it back toward the front to finish in fourth place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wasn’t slowing,&quot; Blaney said. &quot;He was drafting to me, and he didn’t lift and just gave me a shot when I’m turning into [Turn] 1, and it spun me out. I was just happy I didn’t hook a right back into everybody and was able to stay on the apron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chastain had one of the fastest cars of the day. He declined to get into the specifics of their conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Busch noted that Hocevar had a lot of &quot;close calls&quot; in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I mean, he wasn’t even clear on me, I had to lift, and he put me in the fence off of two in the first stage,&quot; he told &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/dustinlong/status/1893818800954323341&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;NBC Sports&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;So, he’s just trying to plug holes and doing it last second and last minute, and creating log jams on back. It’s just, do it at the end, you know, do it in the last 30 laps, not in the first 230.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Hocevar’s 45th NASCAR Cup Series race of his career and his seventh top 10 finish. It was the best finish he has had on the circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He previously finished in third place at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/attributes/racing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Watkins Glen&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>RILEY GAINES: Here&apos;s the message President Trump just sent with his order keeping men out of women&apos;s sports</title>
                    
                    <description>President Trump&amp;apos;s executive order ensures that the next generation of female athletes has a fair opportunity to compete with the safety, privacy and equal opportunity they deserve.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The executive order &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports&lt;/a&gt;&quot; ensures that the next generation of female athletes has a fair opportunity to compete with the safety, privacy and equal opportunity they deserve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;’s swift action in fulfilling his campaign promise to protect women’s sports. The clarity and decisiveness of this administration sends a strong message to women and girls across the country: We matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women’s sports were created to celebrate and protect our unique physical attributes, allowing us to develop confidence, resilience, leadership and determination. Our category is separate from men’s – not because we are inferior, but because we are different. We have distinct physiological characteristics, such as lung capacity, height, limb proportions and heart size. These differences impact performance, especially in endurance sports where every breath counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/im-runner-i-know-race-save-womens-sports-has-started-off-great&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;female athletes face different risks&lt;/a&gt;, such as higher susceptibility to stress fractures, ACL tears, and the female athlete triad, which can lead to low energy availability, irregular menstrual cycles, and weakened bones. These conditions put women at greater risk for injuries, eating disorders, anxiety, depression and prolonged recovery times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/trump-vows-cut-off-federal-funding-maine-refsual-comply-no-men-womens-sports-order&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP VOWS TO CUT OFF FEDERAL FUNDING TO MAINE OVER REFUSAL TO COMPLY WITH &apos;NO MEN IN WOMEN&apos;S SPORTS&apos; ORDER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competing against other women is already a demanding physical challenge – but at least it is a fair one. Ignoring male physical advantage contradicts science and common sense, violates the privacy of female athletes in locker rooms, and leads to preventable injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I began swimming at 4 years old. After 18 years of grueling practices, strict nutrition plans, disciplined sleep schedules, physical rehabilitation and social sacrifices, I earned the opportunity to compete at the highest level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my senior year at the University of Kentucky, I was ranked third in the nation and was familiar with the swimmer ranked second. However, I had never heard of the swimmer ranked first – a rarity in elite competition, where top athletes usually know one another. After some research, I discovered that the top-ranked swimmer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/riley-gaines-all-out-war-female-athletes-ends-now-thanks-president-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Lia Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, had competed as Will Thomas the previous year on the men’s team, ranking 462nd. He was (and still is) a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I assumed the NCAA would recognize the unfairness of the situation, as my teammates and I did.  I expected them to intervene to protect fairness and privacy in women’s sports. But instead, they did nothing. We endured the violating experience of being forced to share a locker room with Thomas and watched as he dominated the most impressive and accomplished female swimmers in the world by entire body lengths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 200 freestyle, Thomas and I tied down to the hundredth of a second. Yet, the NCAA gave Thomas the trophy. When I asked why, an official told me they had been advised that Thomas needed to hold the trophy for photos. At that moment, it became painfully clear: the NCAA was willing to ignore, undermine, and betray female athletes to validate the feelings and identity of a man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actions of this administration offer long-overdue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/female-athlete-who-fought-protect-girls-sports-won-supreme-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;vindication for female athletes&lt;/a&gt; who have been sidelined and harassed for daring to defend themselves. This executive order provides hope for the next generation, reinforcing that fairness, safety and privacy in women’s sports must be protected. Momentum is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2025, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/clock-ticking-ncaa-change-its-trans-policy-protect-womens-sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NCAA took initial steps&lt;/a&gt; toward restoring fairness by limiting competition in women’s sports to women. However, the Department of Education has identified loopholes in the policy, acknowledging that more work is needed. I urge the NCAA to recognize and uphold the achievements of female athletes and correct the injustices we have endured over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting to protect women’s sports hasn’t been easy. But courage begets courage and there is strength in numbers. Let us continue defending truth, common sense and the rights of women. The next generation of female athletes is depending on us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/riley-gaines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RILEY GAINES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

He was then on the Los Angeles Chargers’ staff in 2021as their linebackers coach. He was let go after the 2022 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, he rejoined Payton but with the Broncos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Broncos went from a team at the bottom of the league in points and yards allowed in 2023 to one of the best defenses in the NFL in 2024 – ranked third in points allowed and seventh in yards allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denver made the playoffs but lost to the Buffalo Bills in the wild card round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Images showed the senior transfer from High Point spitting out pieces of his teeth as he appeared to be in tremendous pain as he lay on the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma held a 73-64 lead with 6:57 left in the game at that point. The Sooners beat &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/mississippi-state-bulldogs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the Bulldogs&lt;/a&gt; 93-87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The school’s trainer, Seth Tisdale, told the school’s radio broadcast team that Miles chipped two teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our team dentist was in [the locker room] when I went to do radio,&quot; Sooners head coach Porter Moser said, via &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/oklahomas-duke-miles-loses-multiple-teeth-after-face-hits-floor-diving-for-ball-in-win-vs-mississippi-state/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;CBS Sports&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;His teeth aren&apos;t that pretty right now. He was doing fine when I left. He was just hustling, diving for a ball.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miles did return to the floor after the incident. He had three points in 16 minutes for Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/alex-rodriguez-helps-bucknell-university-student-win-10000-thanks-clutch-shot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALEX RODRIGUEZ HELPS BUCKNELL UNIVERSITY STUDENT WIN $10,000 THANKS TO CLUTCH SHOT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He started his collegiate career at Troy and played through his junior season. He transferred to High Point before the 2023-24 season and averaged 17.5 points per game with a 52.8% shooting percentage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has started in each of the 27 games he’s appeared in for the Sooners this season. He is averaging 10.1 points and 2.1 assists per game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma is 17-10 on the season and 4-10 against SEC opponents. The Sooners are hoping to clinch a spot in the field of 68 for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-bk/march-madness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;NCAA Tournament&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;u&gt;sports coverage on X,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and subscribe to&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt; the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>MSNBC host asks if military official originally hired by Trump was &apos;fired because he was Black&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>MSNBC host Symone Sanders-Townsend remarked on President Donald Trump firing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Charles “CQ&amp;quot; Brown Jr.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MSNBC’s Symone Sanders-Townsend asked whether President Donald &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-goes-unprecedented-pentagon-firing-spree-report&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump fired Air Force Gen&lt;/a&gt;. Charles &quot;CQ&quot; Brown Jr because he was Black despite Trump originally nominating Brown for a different position in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders-Townsend was part of a panel on MSNBC’s &quot;The Weekend&quot; that commented on Trump firing several top military officers, including Brown, who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump announced that he plans on nominating retired Lt. Gen. Dan &quot;Razin&quot; Caine to take his place, marking the first time a president has pulled a military officer out of retirement to head the Joint Chiefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She took issue with Brown’s firing, insisting that his race needed to be considered as a factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/inspector-general-dismissed-trump-calls-mass-firings-threat-democracy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INSPECTOR GENERAL DISMISSED BY TRUMP CALLS MASS FIRINGS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is going on?&quot; she asked. &quot;And I just, I mean, I feel like that’s what people across…what is going on here? Just really what is going on between CQ Brown, and I’m just going to say it — we need to ask the question: was CQ Brown fired because he was Black? Because it’s not that he’s unqualified, right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was confirmed by the Senate. And then when it comes to Ukraine, I just, like, is Ronald Reagan rolling over in his grave right now?,&quot; she continued. &quot;Where are the real Republicans in America? Where are the people that care about democracy? I am just, I’m very confused and concerned.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-confirms-charles-brown-as-air-force-chief-of-staff-making-him-first-african-american-service-chief&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Brown was originally nominated&lt;/a&gt; for the Air Force chief of staff by Trump during his first term in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My decision to appoint @usairforce General Charles Brown as the USA’s first-ever African American military service chief has now been approved by the Senate,&quot; Trump tweeted after Brown was confirmed in June 2020. &quot;A historic day for America! Excited to work even more closely with Gen. Brown, who is a Patriot and Great Leader!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/who-is-air-force-gen-charles-q-brown-jr-likely-replacement-gen-milley-joint-chiefs-staff-chair&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Brown was later nominated&lt;/a&gt; to be the first African-American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2023 by then-President Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firing Brown was just one of many changes Trump announced to top military brass in recent days, including plans to replace the U.S. Navy&apos;s top officer, Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to lead one of the military branches. Trump is also removing the Air Force vice chief of staff, Gen. Jim Slife, and the judge advocates general of the Army, Navy and Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When Game 5 of the World Series ended with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/los-angeles-dodgers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Dodgers&lt;/a&gt; celebrating at Yankee Stadium, every fan of the pinstripes had to hear Frank Sinatra’s timeless &quot;New York, New York&quot; ring out as they exited their seats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If losing the World Series was not enough, hearing that song, which is played win or loss at Yankee Stadium throughout the season, poured salt on the wound for some. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/new-york-yankees&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Yankees tradition&lt;/a&gt; will be no more, as a team spokesman confirmed to the New York Post on Sunday that &quot;Theme From New York, New York&quot; will not play after losses in the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, a rotation of songs will be played after the Yankees lose at home. An example was Sinatra’s iconic tune, &quot;That’s Life,&quot; which played after Sunday’s spring training loss to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/detroit-tigers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Detroit Tigers&lt;/a&gt; at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yankees have been a team with long-standing tradition, and it remains that way. However, some tweaks to those traditions are being made, and the song blaring over the Yankee Stadium speakers is just the latest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest change, which has been called for by many on and off the field, is a new facial hair policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/sports/yankees-aaron-judge-reveals-stance-beard-policy-whether-hell-grow-one&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YANKEES&apos; AARON JUDGE REVEALS STANCE ON BEARD POLICY, WHETHER HE&apos;LL GROW ONE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move was considered stunning because, since 1976, facial hair other than a mustache was not allowed by any Yankees player, coach or staff member. Now, general managing partner Hal Steinbrenner announced on Friday that a &quot;well-groomed&quot; beard can be seen on a player, coach or staff member’s face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;In recent weeks, I have spoken to a large number of former and current Yankees — spanning several eras — to elicit their perspectives on our longstanding facial hair and grooming policy, and I appreciate their earnest and varied feedback,&quot; Steinbrenner said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These most recent conversations are an extension of ongoing internal dialogue that dates back several years. Ultimately, the final decision rests with me, and after great consideration, we will be amending our expectations to allow our players and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving forward. It is the appropriate time to move beyond the familiar comfort of our former policy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yankees’ team manual used to read, &quot;All players, coaches and male executives are forbidden to display any facial hair other than mustaches [except for religious reasons], and scalp hair may not be grown below the collar. Long sideburns and mutton chops are not specifically banned.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, what exactly deems a well-groomed beard remains to be seen, but this is a big deal for the Yankees and its fan base – &quot;seismic,&quot; as longtime play-by-play commentator Michael Kay put it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankees captain Aaron Judge, who said he would not be growing a beard despite the rule change, noted what Steinbrenner hinted at regarding players potentially not wanting to join the Yankees in free agency because of the no-beard rule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I really didn’t think it was that big of a deal until it got brought up the past couple weeks. I think the rule will be good. I think it’ll help a lot of guys. If it gets us a couple more players that’ll help us win games, everybody will be on board for that,&quot; Judge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the no-beard rule scrapped (to an extent), and no more upbeat Sinatra being played after a loss, the Yankees are heading into the 2025 season looking to get back to the World Series with a new look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Follow Fox News Digital’s &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/FoxNewsSports_&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sports coverage on X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, and subscribe to &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Bureaucracies &apos;cannibalizing our nation&apos; lawmaker says, expressing empathy for federal workers facing job cuts</title>
                    
                    <description>Rep. Clay Higgins expresses empathy for federal workers facing joblessness, but says bureaucracies have been &amp;quot;cannibalizing our nation.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Trump &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;administration &lt;/a&gt;moves to slash thousands of government jobs, Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., issued a message to federal workers facing joblessness, expressing empathy for their situation while also asserting that bureaucracies have been &quot;cannibalizing&quot; the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higgins, who has served as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;House &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;lawmaker &lt;/a&gt;since 2017, also declared that federal workers&apos; jobs were not more important than other Americans&apos; private sector jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I’m a compassionate man. I know loss and struggle, I understand financial hardship, I know what it is to face eviction, I know hunger, I’ve lived through despair,&quot; Higgins noted in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-lays-out-roles-probationary-employees-dems-claim-critical-employees-being-cut&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRUMP ADMIN LAYS OUT ROLES OF ‘PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES’ AS DEMS CLAIM CRITICAL EMPLOYEES ARE BEING CUT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, to the scores of thousands of FedGov employees who are facing unemployment because your elected officials have, for decades, grown the Federal bureaucracies into corrupt, bloated, weaponized devourers of America’s treasure and oppressors of American freedom… I say to you that I feel your pain and I wish you well, but your job was no more important than the carpenter, the machinist, the welder, the cop, the trucker, the warehouse worker, the salesman, the waitress, the heavy equipment operator… every American who lives down the street from you whose job has not been insulated from the real world,&quot; he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our federal government bureaucracies are literally cannibalizing our nation, eating our children’s future. MAGA Republicans are going to bring our federal government back into sustainability. If you’ve lost your job, I’m sorry for your struggle. Pick yourself up, all of us will give you a hand. We’re all Americans, join us in saving our beloved Republic,&quot; Higgins concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/dc-federal-workers-panic-over-novel-experience-job-insecurity-trump-cuts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DC FEDERAL WORKERS IN A ‘PANIC’ OVER NOVEL EXPERIENCE OF JOB INSECURITY WITH TRUMP CUTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The congressman&apos;s message comes as the Trump administration seeks to slash the size of the federal bureaucracy, with billionaire business tycoon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elon-musk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; playing a key role in helping to uncover government waste, fraud, and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., commented, &quot;The amount of waste, fraud, and ABUSE of taxpayers which is being uncovered in the federal government is absolutely shameful. Central Illinois farms, families and businesses are struggling because of inflation, driven by reckless government spending. Finally, we have a President who is reforming our government into one that works for you. Thank you President Trump!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dod-tells-civilian-workforce-ignore-elon-musks-request-report-productivity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOD TELLS CIVILIAN WORKFORCE TO IGNORE ELON MUSK&apos;S REQUEST TO REPORT PRODUCTIVITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another recent tweet, Higgins said, &quot;Hey, bureaucrats… Wake up and pack up. America is pretty much done with you and your elitist attitude. You’re being daily weighed in the balances, and found wanting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Massive airship could shake up cargo transport</title>
                    
                    <description>Tech expert Kurt “CyberGuy&amp;quot; Knutsson says this enormous airship revolutionizes cargo transport by flying to remote areas.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;French startup Flying Whales is on a mission to transform cargo transport with its ambitious Large Capacity Airship 60 Tonne (LCA60T) project. This colossal helium-filled airship, measuring 656 feet in length, aims to connect population centers with remote, inaccessible areas by moving important goods and materials without touching the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberguy.com/newsletter/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stay protected &amp;amp; informed!

The airship&apos;s helium volume reaches 6.3 million cubic feet, enabling it to reach a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet. Propelled by 32 electric propeller drives with a combined 5,360 horsepower, the LCA60T can achieve a top speed of 63 mph. The LCA60T incorporates several cutting-edge design elements. Its skeletal frame features a composite beam lattice construction with metal joints. The airship contains 14 non-pressurized helium cells, equipped with advanced sensor systems. The 315-foot-long cargo hold is a structural compartment with dual sliding doors. A specially developed Diatex ultralight polyester textile serves as the outer skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberguy.com/future-tech/solar-powered-blimp-could-bring-high-speed-internet-to-your-area/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SOLAR-POWERED BLIMP COULD BRING HIGH-SPEED INTERNET TO YOUR AREA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, the LCA60T will use a combination of high-voltage lithium-ion batteries and turbine generators. However, Flying Whales plans to transition to hydrogen fuel cell power generation to reduce emissions and make it a more sustainable option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberguy.com/future-tech/is-this-656-foot-airyacht-the-luxury-transportation-of-the-future/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;IS THIS 656-FOOT AIRYACHT THE LUXURY TRANSPORTATION OF THE FUTURE?&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flying Whales has formed strategic partnerships to bring its vision to life. Evolito is supplying 32 D250 electric motors, each producing 308 horsepower, for propulsion. The company has already raised more than $300 million in public and private funding and began wind tunnel testing of its outer skin material in late January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberguy.com/future-tech/solar-powered-aircraft-groundbreaking-22-hour-autonomous-flight/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SOLAR-POWERED AIRCRAFT ACHIEVES GROUNDBREAKING 22-HOUR AUTONOMOUS FLIGHT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LCA60T&apos;s versatility opens up numerous possibilities. It can extract renewable wood from remote logging sites and supply materials for energy construction projects. The airship can also provide humanitarian aid, deliver cargo containers from land or ship and deploy temporary modular hospitals in underserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cyberguy.com/YouTube&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flying Whales&apos; LCA60T represents a bold vision for the future of cargo transport. While the project faces significant technical and economic challenges, its potential to revolutionize logistics and connect isolated regions is undeniable. As the company progresses towards its 2027 flight testing goal, the world will be watching to see if this modern airship can truly take flight and usher in a new era of sustainable, accessible transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you believe governments and private companies should prioritize funding airship technology over other sustainable transportation solutions?

                    <title>Millions more food stamp recipients required to work under new House GOP proposal</title>
                    
                    <description>A senior House Republican is leading the way on work requirements for federal benefits as GOP lawmakers work to cobble together a plan on reconciliation.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST ON FOX: &lt;/strong&gt;House Republicans are eyeing reforms to federal benefits that would impose work requirements on a wider swath of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., chair of the right-wing pragmatist Main Street Caucus, is planning to introduce the &quot;America Works Act of 2025,&quot; Fox News Digital has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill would mandate that childless, able-bodied Americans on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) – colloquially known as food stamps – between the ages of 18 and 65 take on at least 20 hours per week of work or work-related education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with a dependent child under age 7 would be exempt, according to a summary provided to Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/key-conservative-caucus-draws-red-line-house-budget-plan&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SCOOP: KEY CONSERVATIVE CAUCUS DRAWS RED LINE ON HOUSE BUDGET PLAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Able-bodied people who can work should work if we want to continue to have our welfare programs be pathways out of poverty,&quot; Johnson told Fox News Digital in an interview. &quot;There is no reliable path out of poverty that doesn&apos;t have work, training and education at its core.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes as House Republicans get ready to negotiate on how to meet spending cut targets in their plans to move President &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Donald Trump’s&lt;/a&gt; agenda via the budget reconciliation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By leveling the threshold for passage in the House and Senate at a simple majority, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/one-bill-two-bills-i-dont-care-trump-promises-get-large-reconciliation-bill-passed-either-way&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;reconciliation allows&lt;/a&gt; the party in power to pass budgetary or other fiscal priorities in a massive piece of legislation with zero support from lawmakers on the opposing side. The threshold for passage in the Senate is otherwise two-thirds for most items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/essential-our-nations-sovereignty-noncitizen-voter-crackdown-led-gop-ahead-2026-midterms&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NONCITIZEN VOTER CRACKDOWN LED BY GOP AHEAD OF 2026 MIDTERMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOP lawmakers are looking to accomplish a wide swath of Trump policies, from more funding for the border wall and detention beds to eliminating taxes on tipped and overtime wages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To offset the cost of that spending, the House’s reconciliation framework directs several committees to find areas for spending cuts. The House Committee on Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, must aim to cut at least $230 billion in spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new bill gives the Department of Agriculture (USDA), which oversees food stamps, the ability to exempt people who live in counties where the unemployment rate exceeds 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two sources familiar with discussions told Fox News Digital that Johnson’s bill closely resembles what will end up in Republicans’ reconciliation bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about cost projections, however, Johnson emphasized that his bill was motivated by social rather than fiscal change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It would be expected to be a major cost-savings, and while I think that’s important, my primary motivator is how much work requirements have proven to improve lives as opposed to how much money they save,&quot; he said. &quot;I want people to escape poverty.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, adults aged 18 to 54 can receive three months of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/snap-recipients-may-barred-from-junk-food-purchases-under-new-house-gop-bill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;SNAP benefits&lt;/a&gt; in three years at most before a requirement kicks in to work at least 80 hours per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson’s bill would also strip present exemptions for young adults who recently aged out of foster care and for veterans. Those were included during bipartisan negotiations on raising the debt limit in 2023, as part of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The concessions we had to make in the Fiscal Responsibility Act to get things done were not helpful changes,&quot; Johnson said when asked about the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was just telling all veterans and all young adult former foster kids that the work requirements didn&apos;t apply to them, and that&apos;s not actually helpful to getting them to a better financial path.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed out there would still be exceptions for pregnant women, people with disabilities, people living in high-unemployment counties, and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My bill would go back to the way it was before, which is the same eligibility requirements applied to veterans and foster kids are applied to everybody else,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Top moments from Joy Reid&apos;s soon-to-be canceled MSNBC show</title>
                    
                    <description>Former MSNBC host Joy Reid has made headlines over last few years for attacking President Trump and his supporters on her now-canceled show, &amp;quot;The ReidOut.&amp;quot;</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Joy Reid&apos;s days as an MSNBC host are numbered as the network announced the cancellation of her &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-cancels-joy-reids-show-part-programming-overhaul-liberal-network&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;show, &quot;The ReidOut.&quot;&lt;/a&gt; However, over the past few years of hosting her own show, Reid&apos;s over-the-top liberal and often times incendiary commentary went viral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid’s 7 p.m. ET program will be replaced by a show featuring Symone Sanders-Townsend, a former spokesperson to Vice President Kamala Harris, Alicia Menendez, the daughter of disgraced former Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J. and RNC Chair turned MSNBC host Michael Steele, according to a source familiar with the plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid will host the final &quot;ReidOut&quot; this week after years of attacking Republicans and the president, who she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-host-joy-reid-compares-trump-hitler-during-rant-how-fascism-takes-root&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;has compared to Hitler&lt;/a&gt; multiple times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing that was true yesterday about how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6364351917112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;flawlessly this campaign&lt;/a&gt; was run, is not true now. I mean, this really was a historic flawlessly run campaign,&quot; Reid said as the results of the 2024 president election poured in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former MSNBC host pointed to the celebrity endorsements Harris garnered throughout her limited campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Queen Latifah never endorses anyone. She came out and endorsed her. She had every prominent celebrity voice. She had the Taylor Swift, the Swifties, she had the B-hive. You could not have run a better campaign in that short period of time. I still think that&apos;s true,&quot; she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/conservatives-say-good-riddance-joy-reids-msnbc-show-liberals-slam-network-shake-up&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONSERVATIVES SAY ‘GOOD RIDDANCE’ TO JOY REID&apos;S MSNBC SHOW AS LIBERALS SLAM NETWORK SHAKE-UP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to inflation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/joy-reid-claims-everyday-americans-never-heard-word-inflation-until-gop-made-campaign-issue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reid claimed that&lt;/a&gt; most people would have &quot;never used that word ever in their lives&quot; before the 2022 election cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only people I ever hear use the word ‘inflation’ are journalists and economists,&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/joy-reid-claims-everyday-americans-never-heard-word-inflation-until-gop-made-campaign-issue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reid told MSNBC&apos;s Nicolle Wallace &lt;/a&gt;in November 2022, when inflation was at a 40-year high. &quot;So, that is not part of the normal lexicon of the way people talk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She continued, &quot;So, it’s interesting that Republicans are doing something they don’t normally do, which is not use the common tongue, not use just common English like they sort of do on their campaigns like they do with crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/amber-rose-claps-back-joy-reid-after-criticizing-convention-speech-stop-being-race-baiter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;AMBER ROSE CLAPS BACK AT JOY REID AFTER CRITICIZING CONVENTION SPEECH: ‘STOP BEING A RACE BAITER’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid began a January 2024 segment with, &quot;Over the weekend, President Biden said he&apos;s ready to take action if Congress is serious about solving the border issue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSNBC then cut to Biden&apos;s remarks, which were abruptly interrupted by Reid&apos;s voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Starting another f---ing&apos; war,&quot; Reid could be heard saying with a chuckle before her audio was immediately cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the show, Reid offered an apology to viewers for the &quot;&apos;behind the scenes&apos; chatter&quot; they heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was chatting during a clip that was playing, and you know, we try to keep this show very PG-13, so I just want to apologize to anyone who was listening to my ‘behind the scenes’ chatter. I deeply, deeply apologize for that,&quot; Reid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://foxnews.com/media&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/joy-reid-suggest-biden-recovering-from-covid-exact-same-thing-trump-surviving-assassination-attempt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reid suggested&lt;/a&gt; in July 2024 that Biden recovering from COVID-19 is a &quot;sign of strength&quot; similar to Trump surviving an assassination attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These two men are both elderly. Donald Trump is an elderly man who, for whatever reason, was given nine seconds to take an iconic photo-op during an active shooter situation. Weird situation, we&apos;ll figure that out one day,&quot; Reid said during the coverage of the Republican National Convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This current President of the United States is 81 years old and has COVID, should he be fine in a couple of days, doesn&apos;t that convey exactly the same thing? That he’s strong enough – older than Trump – to have gotten something that used to really be fatal to people his age. So, if he does fine out of it and comes back and is able to do rallies, isn&apos;t that exactly the same?&quot; Reid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/joy-reid-suggests-trump-couldnt-avoid-consequences-his-own-rhetoric-after-assassination-attempt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;JOY REID SUGGESTS TRUMP COULDN&apos;T &apos;AVOID THE CONSEQUENCES&apos; OF HIS OWN RHETORIC AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2020, the MSNBC host &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/joy-reid-no-apology-remarks-deemed-islamophobic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;accused Trump of radicalizing&lt;/a&gt; his supporters, comparing them to Islamic extremists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Leaders, let&apos;s say in the Muslim world, talk a lot of violent talk and encourage their supporters to be willing to commit violence, including on their own bodies, in order to win against whoever they decide is the enemy,&quot; Reid said during her show. &quot;We in the U.S. media describe that as they are radicalizing those people -- particularly when they&apos;re radicalizing young people. That&apos;s how we talk about the way Muslims act. When you see what Donald Trump is doing, is that any different from what we describe as radicalizing people?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments were met with pushback from prominent Democrats, including Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It felt very Taliban to me,&quot; she said, reacting to a North Carolina legislature &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/north-carolina-gop-legislature-attempts-override-democratic-gov-coopers-veto-new-abortion-restrictions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;vote to override&lt;/a&gt; the governor&apos;s veto of legislation banning nearly all abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy in the state in May 2023. &quot;I bring up Taliban a lot w/ my poor beleaguered team, but the thing about Republicans now is that they are acting in very Talibanesque way. They are a religious group of extremists who — they definitely don’t care about children. They want to control women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also referred to Texas pro-life legislation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-joy-reid-compares-texas-republicans-taliban&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;as &quot;Talibanism&quot; in&lt;/a&gt; July 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;So now Texas Republicans are putting bounties on pregnant women. I almost hate to ask what this benighted party will think of next,&quot; she said, agreeing with a Washington Post op-ed titled &quot;Republicans now stand for lawlessness and disorder,&quot; by former columnist Jennifer Rubin. &quot;This is Talibanism. Are Texas conservatives going to be spying on women of childbearing age and turning them in for the bounties?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbcs-joy-reid-loses-roughly-half-her-viewers-since-election-primetime-hosts-also-struggle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOY REID LOSES ROUGHLY HALF HER VIEWERS SINCE THE ELECTION, PRIMETIME HOSTS ALSO STRUGGLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Trump won the election in November 2024, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/joy-reid-sends-message-republicans-ahead-thanksgiving-make-your-own-dinner-maga&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reid unleashed on&lt;/a&gt; his supporters the night before Thanksgiving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You right-wingers shouldn’t have to suffer the consequences of your votes? ‘You don’t want to be around me because I voted for fascism. No fair. I am coughing on you with COVID, but you want me to wear a mask for your safety? No fair. My body, my choice.’ Well, here&apos;s an alternative thought — make your own dinner, MAGA. Make your own sandwiches, wipe your own tears, troll amongst yourselves with Elon, and leave us alone,&quot; Reid said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reid accused Republicans of worshiping Trump &quot;instead of Jesus&quot; during the rant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stop acting like we owe you,&quot; she added. &quot;Our Thanksgiving, our choice.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbcs-joy-reid-admits-affirmative-action-harvard&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Reid reacted to the&lt;/a&gt; U.S. Supreme Court ruling that affirmative action in college admissions violated the 14th Amendment&apos;s equal protection clause in July 2023 during an appearance on MSNBC&apos;s Chris Hays&apos; show. While opposing the decision, Reid admitted that she benefited from affirmative action herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I got into Harvard only because of affirmative action,&quot; Reid said. &quot;I went to a school no one had ever heard of in Denver, Colorado, in a small suburb. I didn’t go to Exeter or Andover. I didn’t have college test prep. I just happened to be really nerdy and smart and have really good grades and good SAT scores.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News&apos; Brian Flood, Joseph Wulfsohn, Lindsay Kornick, and Gabriel Hays contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/pope-francis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Pope Francis&lt;/a&gt;, 88, was resting Monday morning, his 10th day at Rome&apos;s Gemelli Hospital for a complex lung infection that led to the early stages of kidney insufficiency, according to the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The night passed well, the pope slept and is resting,&quot; the Vatican said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if he was awake and eating breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis was admitted to the hospital on Feb. 14 after a weeklong bout of bronchitis worsened. Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and subsequently the onset of pneumonia in both lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/pope-francis-shares-written-message-while-continuing-hospitalization&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POPE FRANCIS SHARES WRITTEN MESSAGE WHILE CONTINUING HOSPITALIZATION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late Sunday, doctors said blood tests revealed &quot;early, slight kidney insufficiency&quot; but that it remained under control. The doctors said Francis remained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;critical condition&lt;/a&gt; but had not experienced any further respiratory crises since Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis, who had part of one lung removed when he was younger, was receiving high flows of supplemental oxygen, and received two blood transfusions on Sunday to increase hemoglobin levels. Doctors said his prognosis was guarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pope was alert and responsive on Sunday and attended Mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis&apos; condition is touch-and-go, given his age, fragility and pre-existing lung disease, doctors said. The main threat to Francis, doctors warned, is sepsis, a serious infection of the blood that can arise as a complication of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has been no indication of any onset of sepsis as of Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday is Francis&apos; 10th day in the hospital, matching the longest hospitalization of his papacy. He spent 10 days at Gemelli Hospital in 2021 after he had 13 inches of his colon removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Timothy Dolan said Sunday in New York that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/religion/roman-catholic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Catholic faithful&lt;/a&gt; were united &quot;at the bedside of a dying father,&quot; an acknowledgment of Francis&apos; short time left that church leaders in Rome have not said publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/world/pope-francis-had-peaceful-nights-rest-hospital-following-respiratory-crisis-vatican-says&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;POPE FRANCIS HAD PEACEFUL NIGHT&apos;S REST AT HOSPITAL FOLLOWING RESPIRATORY CRISIS, VATICAN SAYS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;As our Holy Father Pope Francis is in very, very fragile health, and probably close to death,&quot; Dolan said in his homily from the pulpit of St. Patrick’s Cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dolan later told reporters he hoped and prayed that Francis would &quot;bounce back.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>Mississippi sheriff&apos;s deputy shot, killed while responding to domestic call: &apos;Died a hero&apos;</title>
                    
                    <description>A sheriff&amp;apos;s deputy in Hinds County, Mississippi, was shot and killed while responding to a domestic call on Sunday night, according to Sheriff Tyree Jones.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A Mississippi community is mourning the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;loss of a sheriff&apos;s deputy&lt;/a&gt; after he was shot and killed while responding to a domestic call Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones identified the slain deputy as 37-year-old Martin Shields, Jr., in a Facebook post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shields had been with the Hinds County Sheriff&apos;s Office for about nine months, but &quot;his law enforcement career extends beyond being employed with the HCSO,&quot; the sheriff said. Memorial posts on social media showed previous employment with the Mississippi Department of Corrections and the Jackson Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shields&apos; father retired from HCSO as a captain, according to the Jackson Fallen Firefighters Memorial Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-police-officer-killed-hospital-shooting-gunman-dead-officials-say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PENNSYLVANIA POLICE OFFICER KILLED IN HOSPITAL SHOOTING; GUNMAN DEAD, OFFICIALS SAY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limited details are available, but Jones had said a couple of hours earlier that there was a &quot;very serious situation&quot; taking place in the 15000 block of Midway Road in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/mississippi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Terry, Mississippi,&lt;/a&gt; which is approximately 15 miles southwest of Jackson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two deputies, Shields and an unidentified Hinds County deputy, were responding to a domestic call at a residence at the aforementioned address. Jones said he heard the other deputy come across the radio calling for &quot;shots fired&quot; and made his way to the scene on Midway Road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &quot;Be On the Lookout&quot; alert was issued Sunday evening for Eric Brown, 42, who was &quot;wanted for questioning regarding the situation on Midway Road&quot; and was considered armed and dangerous. The alert was canceled sometime before 10 p.m. when police said there was no longer an active threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Facebook post made at about 10:19 p.m. announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/crime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the deputy&apos;s death&lt;/a&gt; and also said an &quot;unidentified Black male subject believed to be related to the call&quot; was found dead inside the home on Midway Road. It was not stated if that person was Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation into the shooting remains active and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is assisting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/us/two-virginia-beach-police-officers-shot-dead-defenseless-during-late-night-traffic-stop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWO VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE OFFICERS SHOT DEAD WHILE &apos;DEFENSELESS&apos; DURING LATE-NIGHT TRAFFIC STOP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones wrote a heartfelt tribute to Shields on his professional Facebook page early Monday morning, sharing that the two men had just responded to a capsized boat together earlier in the day. He said that while he was responding to the &quot;shots fired&quot; call, he paged Shields several times with no answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The deputy who called ‘shots fired’ was in survival mode due to the situation but still performed very heroic acts. My heart sank as I rushed to the scene, not getting a response from the fallen deputy. Just prior to my arrival, I learned that he had been shot and was obviously deceased,&quot; Jones wrote, adding there was an &quot;outpouring of support&quot; at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Shields &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/patriotism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&quot;died a hero&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and &quot;while responding to a call for service to assist someone in need.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;He fulfilled his assignment and his God-given mission on earth. Pray for his family, his friends, the many lives he touched, and the men and women of the HCSO as we all prepare for a final salute,&quot; he wrote. &quot;There’s absolutely no way I could ever imagine or prepare to tell a family their deputy will not be coming home from their tour of duty. However, tragically, I found myself in that situation late this evening.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shields&apos; death marks the latest killing in a deadly weekend for law enforcement across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Virginia Beach police officers died Saturday morning after they were both shot while conducting a traffic stop late Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Pennsylvania, West York Borough Patrolman Andrew Duarte was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;shot and killed&lt;/a&gt; while responding to an active shooter at UPMC Memorial Hospital on Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fox News Digital has reached out to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and Hinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    <title>NY lawmaker introduces bill to ban Zyn, other flavored nicotine pouches after FDA&apos;s support of product</title>
                    
                    <description>A New York state lawmaker is proposing a ban on the sale of flavored nicotine pouches, even after the FDA authorized the product as a helpful alternative to cigarettes.</description>

                    
                        <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A New York state lawmaker is proposing a ban on the sale of what he described as &quot;highly addictive&quot; flavored nicotine pouches, even after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration came out in support of the product due to data showing it can help smokers ditch cigarettes, which can cause cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal, a Democrat, said he opposes replacing cigarettes, which contain tobacco, with nicotine pouches, noting that he wants to keep the flavored pouches away from young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This product is distinguishable from other smokeless tobacco products because they do not contain tobacco leaf, rather contain nicotine derived from tobacco or synthetic nicotine,&quot; Hoylman-Sigal said in his bill memo, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nypost.com/2025/02/23/us-news/ny-legislator-proposes-ban-on-flavored-nicotine-pouches-including-zyn-despite-fda-backing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Regardless, nicotine in any form and in any product is a highly addictive substance. This legislation would align New York values in prohibiting enticing flavors for all nicotine products — including nicotine pouches,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/south-carolina-bill-ban-smoking-inside-cars-children-passengers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;SOUTH CAROLINA BILL WOULD BAN SMOKING INSIDE CARS WHILE CHILDREN ARE PASSENGERS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, also a Democrat, is introducing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;companion bill&lt;/a&gt; to ban nicotine pouches in the state legislature&apos;s lower chamber, the New York Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There’s a lot greater awareness about nicotine patches,&quot; said Rosenthal, who first introduced a version of her bill in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the FDA approved 10 flavors of Philip Morris International’s Zyn brand of nicotine pouches, including cinnamon, coffee, mint, menthol and peppermint. This was the first time the agency authorized sales of nicotine pouches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicotine pouches are held in the mouth and dissolve between the tongue and gum. In contrast to cigarettes and chewing tobacco, Zyn does not contain harmful substances linked to risks of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;cancer or other diseases&lt;/a&gt;, according to the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data also shows that a significant number of adults who used cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products switched entirely to Zyn, the FDA said. But Hoylman-Siegal is concerned about the product&apos;s youth appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our bill is targeted at the flavored products most likely to be used by young people,&quot; he told the New York Post. &quot;With our bill, we’re trying to stop young people from getting hooked on favored Zyn products.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, federal data shows that fewer than 2% of high school and middle school students in the country use nicotine pouches. The FDA also put in place restrictions to prevent companies from marketing nicotine pouches to the youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco companies now turn to alternatives to cigarettes amid a dip in smoking rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/travel/popular-italian-city-officially-bans-cigarette-smoking-outdoors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POPULAR ITALIAN CITY OFFICIALLY BANS CIGARETTE SMOKING OUTDOORS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt; has already banned flavored e-cigarettes, although critics argue that the law is not adequately enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s very similar to the issue involving flavored vapes,&quot; Hoylman-Sigal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Erkilla, director of regulatory science at Philip Morris International, which produces Zyn, argues against New York banning Zyn and other nicotine pouches, saying that the &quot;unintended consequences&quot; include leaving 1.6 million tobacco smokers with fewer alternatives and that a ban could even lead to an uptick in smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The most harmful product is the combustible smoking cigarette. We should let smokers know there are other options out there. We shouldn’t take away their choice,&quot; Erkilla told the New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
